<br>
<br>
V1.0.0

<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for using Comet Prompt. Comet Prompt (CP) is a better version on the original cmd.
<br>
<br>
CP has the original cmd commands and, upgraded for maximum fuctionality and performance.
<br>
<br>
Main Features of CP include:
<br>
<br>
Backup of CP Data (data/backup) - If you ever want to move all your CP Data and settings to another Computer, use this command.
<br>
<br>
- Backup may not consist of all data, depending on the version you are on. Backups may not also work while trasfering data to 2 diffrent version on Comet Prompt.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Search for Files (data/search) - I know, I know. This is already there in Windows Explorer, but this one has faster algorithms to ensure faster speeds while searching. (This may vary with computer, some cputer may recive a huge performace boost from this, yet some may computers searches mill be slower.)
<br>
<br>
Reset of Data (reset/data) - Did something wrong in the config files and didn't know how to fix it? This command will reset ALL your data. (If you have chashes occuring or unsal behaviior, this may fix it. If not, unistall Comet Engine and install it again)
<br>
<br>
Settings (settings) - Settings! You can costimise CP without going in the config files.
<br>
<br>
- Not all the settings may the the same due to the fact it your operating system supports the settings. If this setting is pre-disabled from changing, you need to do some re-configuration so that you are able to change the settings.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Local Data Server (localdataserver) - You can have some fun in a sandboxed area where you can't affect your PC. (More features to LDS will be added soon)
